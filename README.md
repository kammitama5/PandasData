# PandasData

I'm taking an online class (which has its own repo), but I'm new to Pandas.
This folder is not for assignments, but for :

1. Learning about Pandas and using Jupyter/Python/Pandas
2. Understanding key concepts in Data Science
3. Identify weaknesses where I can practice on my own

Topics covered of interest:

1. Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
   * podcast: http://dataskeptic.com/epnotes/goodharts-law.php => DataSkeptic Studios
   * think skeptically about data => eg. Google page rank algorithm
